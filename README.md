# Digital Graveyard of Scrapped Projects

A unique, scroll-based showcase for my abandoned, scrapped, and forgotten web project ideas. This project visualizes discarded concepts as a scattered pile of papers that you can scroll through in a 3D-like environment.

## The Concept

Every developer has a folder of unfinished projects, dead-ends, and half-baked ideas. Instead of letting them rot in a forgotten directory, this page gives them a final resting place. It serves as a visual, interactive archive of what could have been.

The layout is designed to feel like you're looking down a road littered with discarded notes, with each "note" being a link to a scrapped project.

## Features

  - **Dynamic 3D Layout:** On page load, project cards are scattered pseudo-randomly in a multi-column layout with slight rotations to give a natural, disordered look.
  - **Interactive Scrolling:** As you scroll down the page, you move "through" the cards, creating a simple but effective parallax effect.
  - **3D Hover Effect:** Hovering over a card lifts it towards the viewer (`translateZ`) and brings it into focus, removing its rotation and adding a highlight shadow.
  - **Responsive Design:** The layout automatically adjusts to a single column on smaller screens for a better mobile experience.
  - **Vanilla Stack:** Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No external libraries or frameworks are needed.

## Technology Stack

  - **HTML5:** For the core structure and content.
  - **CSS3:** For styling, animations, and the 3D perspective layout.
  - **Vanilla JavaScript:** For dynamically positioning the cards and handling scroll/resize events.
